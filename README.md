LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

1. Filtering and Sorting:
  - Create a list of itnegers and filter out the even numbers using a lambda expression. Then, sort the filtered list in descending order using a lambda expression.
   
2. Custom Comparator:
  - Write a program that uses a lambda expression to sort a list of custom objects by their age. Implement the Comparator interface using a lambda expression.  

ARRAY LIST

3. Student Management System:
  - Create a list of integers and filter out the even numbers using a lambda expression. Then, sort the filtered list in descending order using lambda expression.

4. ArrayList Operations:
  - Write a program that adds 100 random integers to an ArrayList. Then, calculate the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values using methods like stream() and reduce.

HASH MAP

5. Word Frequency Counter:
  - Create a method that creates a String and returns a HashMap<String, Integer> where the keys are words from the String, and the values are the frequencies of those words.

6. Employee Database:
  - Create a HashMap<Integer, Employee> where the key is the Employee ID and the value is an Employee object. Implement methods to add, remove, and retrieve employees by their ID.

TREE MAP

7. Phone Directory:
  - Implement a phone directory using TreeMap<String, String> where the key is the person's name and the value is their phone number. Ensure the name are sorted in natural order.

8. Student Grades:
  - Write a program that stores students' names and their grades in a TreeMap<String, Integer>. Add amethod to display all students and their grades in alphabetical order.

THREAD 

9. Multi-threaded Sum Calculation:
  - Create a program that divides an array of integers into two parts and uses and uses two threads to calculate the sum of each part. Then, combine the results in the main thread.

10. Thread Syncronization:
  - Write a program with a shared counter variable. Create two threads: one increments the counter, and the other decrements it. Use synchronization to prevent race conditions.
