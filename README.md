LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

1. Filtering and Sorting:
  - Create a list of itnegers and filter out the even numbers using a lambda expression. Then, sort the filtered list in descending order using a lambda expression.
   
2. Custom Comparator:
  - Write a program that uses a lambda expression to sort a list of custom objects by their age. Implement the Comparator interface using a lambda expression.  

ARRAY LIST

3. Student Management System:
  - Create a list of integers and filter out the even numbers using a lambda expression. Then, sort the filtered list in descending order using lambda expression.

4. ArrayList Operations:
  - Write a program that adds 100 random integers to an ArrayList. Then, calculate the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values using methods like stream() and reduce.

HASH MAP

5. Word Frequency Counter:
  - Create a method that creates a String and returns a HashMap<String, Integer> where the keys are words from the String, and the values are the frequencies of those words.

6. Employee Database:
  - Create a HashMap<Integer, Employee> where the key is the Employee ID and the value is an Employee object. Implement methods to add, remove, and retrieve employees by their ID.

TREE MAP

7. Phone Directory:
  - Implement a phone directory using TreeMap<String, String> where the key is the person's name and the value is their phone number. Ensure the name are sorted in natural order.

8. Student Grades:
  - Write a program that stores students' names and their grades in a TreeMap<String, Integer>. Add amethod to display all students and their grades in alphabetical order.
